# Foundations

Build the core skills needed for AI in science — from programming basics to machine learning fundamentals.

## Overview

Before diving into domain-specific applications, you'll need solid foundations in:

- **Programming** — Python is the lingua franca of scientific computing
- **Version Control** — Git for reproducible research
- **Machine Learning** — Core concepts and neural networks
- **Research Practices** — Reproducibility and collaboration

## Quick Start

| Your Background | Start Here |
|-----------------|------------|
| New to programming | [Resources](/foundations/resources) — Python basics |
| Know Python, new to ML | [Resources](/foundations/resources) — Neural Networks: Zero to Hero |
| Ready for hands-on | [Tutorials](/foundations/tutorials) |

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with Python basics** if you're new to programming
2. **Learn version control** early — it will save you countless headaches
3. **Move to ML fundamentals** once you're comfortable with Python
4. **Apply to your domain** using the topic-specific resources

> **Pro tip:** Don't try to learn everything at once. Pick one resource from each category and work through it completely before moving on.
