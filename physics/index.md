# Physics

AI and machine learning applications in physics — from physics-informed neural networks to simulation.

## Overview

Physics and ML intersect in several key areas:

- **Physics-Informed ML** — Neural networks that respect physical laws
- **Simulation Acceleration** — ML surrogate models for simulations
- **Quantum ML** — ML for quantum systems
- **Scientific Discovery** — Finding physical laws from data

## Key Areas

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Incorporating physical constraints (PDEs, conservation laws) into neural networks. See [Methods Resources](/methods/resources#physics-informed-neural-networks) for tools and tutorials.

### Simulation Surrogates
ML models that accelerate physics simulations — from CFD to weather prediction. Benchmark datasets available in [Datasets](/physics/datasets).

### Symbolic Regression
Discovering equations from data using techniques like genetic programming and neural symbolic regression.
