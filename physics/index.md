# Physics

AI and machine learning applications in physics — from physics-informed neural networks to simulation.

## Overview

Physics and ML intersect in several key areas:

- **Physics-Informed ML** — Neural networks that respect physical laws
- **Simulation Acceleration** — ML surrogate models for simulations
- **Quantum ML** — ML for quantum systems
- **Scientific Discovery** — Finding physical laws from data

## Quick Start

| Goal | Resource |
|------|----------|
| Learn foundational ML | [Foundations](/foundations) |
| Related: Materials physics | [Materials](/materials) |

## Coming Soon

We're actively developing resources for:

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** — Incorporating physical constraints into neural networks
- **Simulation Surrogates** — ML models that accelerate physics simulations
- **Symbolic Regression** — Discovering equations from data

> **Want to contribute?** If you have resources to share for physics-focused AI/ML, we'd love to include them.
