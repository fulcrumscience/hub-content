# Earth & Climate Science

AI and machine learning for climate modeling, weather prediction, and environmental research.

## Overview

ML is increasingly important for understanding Earth systems:

- **Climate Modeling** — ML-enhanced climate simulations
- **Weather Prediction** — Neural network weather forecasts
- **Remote Sensing** — Satellite data analysis
- **Environmental Monitoring** — Ecosystem and biodiversity tracking

---

## Coming Soon

We're actively developing resources for:

- **Climate ML** — Models for climate prediction and analysis
- **Weather Forecasting** — Neural weather prediction systems
- **Earth Observation** — Satellite and remote sensing ML
- **Environmental Science** — Biodiversity, ecology, conservation

> **Want to contribute?** If you have resources to share for earth and climate science AI/ML, we'd love to include them.
