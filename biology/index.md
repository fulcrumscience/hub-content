# Biology & Drug Discovery

AI and machine learning applications in biology, drug discovery, and life sciences.

## Overview

AI is transforming biological research and drug discovery. Key areas include:

- **Drug Discovery** — ADMET prediction, virtual screening, lead optimization
- **Protein Science** — Structure prediction, protein design
- **Genomics** — Sequence analysis, gene expression
- **Biotechnology** — Protein engineering, synthetic biology
