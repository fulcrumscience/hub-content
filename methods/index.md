# Methods

Machine learning methods commonly used in scientific applications.

## Overview

Scientific ML draws from various methodologies:

- **Graph Neural Networks** — For molecular and materials data
- **Transformers & LLMs** — Language models for science
- **Generative Models** — Designing new molecules and materials
- **Active Learning** — Efficient experimental design
- **Uncertainty Quantification** — Knowing what we don't know

## Quick Start

| Method | Domain Examples |
|--------|-----------------|
| Graph Neural Networks | Molecular property prediction, materials |
| Transformers | Reaction prediction, property prediction |
| Generative Models | Molecule design, materials discovery |
| Active Learning | Self-driving labs, experimental optimization |
